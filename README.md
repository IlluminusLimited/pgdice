# PgDice

PgDice is a utility that builds on top of the excellent gem
 [https://github.com/ankane/pgslice](https://github.com/ankane/pgslice)
 
PgDice  is intended to be used by scheduled background jobs in frameworks like [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq)
where logging and clear exception messages are crucial.

# Disclaimer

There are some features in this gem which allow you to drop database tables. 

If you choose to use this software without a __tested and working__ backup and restore strategy in place then you 
are a fool and will pay the price for your negligence. This software comes with no warranty

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pgdice'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pgdice

## Usage

### Configuration

You must configure `PgDice` before you can use it, otherwise you won't be able to perform any manipulation actions
on tables.

This is an example config from a project using `Sidekiq` 
```ruby
require 'pgdice'
PgDice.configure do |config|
  config.logger = Sidekiq.logger # This defaults to STDOUT if you don't specify a logger
  config.database_url = ENV['DATABASE_URL'] # postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]
  config.approved_tables = ENV['PGDICE_APPROVED_TABLES'] # Comma separated values: 'comments,posts'
end
```

Here's a breakdown of all the configurable things.

`logger` The logger to use.

`database_url` The postgres database url to connect to. This is required since `pgslice` is used to accomplish some tasks
and it only takes a `url` currently.

`approved_tables` This one is important. If you want to manipulate database tables with this gem you're going to
need to add the base table name to this string of comma-separated values.

`additional_validators` This can accept an array of `Proc` or `lambda` type predicates. 
Each predicate will be passed the `params` hash and a `logger`. These predicates are called before doing things like
dropping tables and adding tables.

#### Advanced Configurations

`table_dropper` This defaults to [TableDropper](lib/pgdice/table_dropper.rb) which has a `lambda`-like interface. 
If you would like to provide different behavior for dropping tables (like forcing a dry-run, for example).
This mechanism will be passed the `table_to_drop` and a `logger`.

`pg_connection` This is a `PG::Connection` object used for the database queries made from `pgdice`.
 By default it will be initialized from the `database_url` if left `nil`. Keep in mind the dependency 
 `pgslice` will still establish its own connection using the `database_url` so this feature may not be very
 useful if you are trying to only use one connection for this utility.
 
 `database_connection` You can supply your own [DatabaseConnection](lib/pgdice/database_connection.rb) if you like.
 I'm not sure why you would do this.
 
 `pg_slice_manager` This is an internal wrapper around `pgslice`. [PgSliceManager](lib/pgdice/pg_slice_manager.rb)
  This configuration lets you provide your own if you wish. I'm not sure why you would do this.
 
 `partition_manager` You can supply your own [PartitionManager](lib/pgdice/partition_manager.rb) if you like.
  I'm not sure why you would do this.
  
 `partition_helper` You can supply your own [PartitionHelper](lib/pgdice/partition_helper.rb) if you like.
  I'm not sure why you would do this.
 
### Converting existing tables to partitioned tables

__This should only be used on small tables and ONLY after you have tested it on a non-production copy of your production database.__
In fact, you should just not do this in production. Schedule downtime or something and run it a few times on
a copy of your database. Then practice restoring your database some more.


This command will convert an existing table into 61 partitioned tables (30 past, 30 future, and one for today).

For more information on what's going on in the background see 
[https://github.com/ankane/pgslice](https://github.com/ankane/pgslice)


```ruby
PgDice.partition_helper.partition_table!(table_name: 'comments', 
                                            past: 30, 
                                            future: 30, 
                                            column_name: 'created_at', 
                                            period: 'day')
```

If you mess up (again you shouldn't use this in production). These two methods are useful for writing tests
that work with partitions.

```ruby
PgDice.partition_helper.undo_partitioning!(table_name: 'comments')
```

In `partition_helper` there are versions of the methods that will throw exceptions (ending in `!`) and others 
that will return a truthy value or `false` if there is a failure.


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
