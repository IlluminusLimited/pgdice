 [https://github.com/ankane/pgslice](https://github.com/ankane/pgslice)
 
PgDice  is intended to be used by scheduled background jobs in frameworks like [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq)
where logging and clear exception messages are crucial.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pgdice'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pgdice

## Usage

### Configuration

You must configure `PgDice` before you can use it, otherwise you won't be able to perform any manipulation actions
on tables.

This is an example config from a project using `Sidekiq` 
```ruby
require 'pgdice'
PgDice.configure do |config|
  config.logger = Sidekiq.logger # This defaults to STDOUT if you don't specify a logger
  config.database_url = ENV['DATABASE_URL'] # postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]
  config.approved_tables = ENV['PGDICE_APPROVED_TABLES'] # Comma separated values: 'comments,posts'
end
```

### Converting existing tables to partitioned tables

__This should only be used on small tables and ONLY after you have tested it on a non-production copy of your production database__

```ruby
PgDice.
```
